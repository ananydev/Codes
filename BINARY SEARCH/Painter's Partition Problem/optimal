Output:The answer is: 60.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N * log(sum(arr[])-max(arr[])+1)), where N = size of the array, sum(arr[]) = sum of all array elements, max(arr[]) = maximum of all array elements.
Reason: We are applying binary search on [max(arr[]), sum(arr[])]. Inside the loop, we are calling the countPainters() function for the value of ‘mid’. Now, inside the countPainters() function, we are using a loop that runs for N times.

Space Complexity:  O(1) as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
